# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to analyze a group of green energy stocks, all in an effort to advise a family who wants to invest in green energy. To accomplish this, I've used an excel file containing specific green energy stock data, and excel's Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) computer programming language. In this project, I've used VBA macros that can trigger pop-ups and inputs, read and change cell values, and format cells; used for loops and conditionals to direct logic flow; and used nested for loops. Also, once I had completed the original script, I refactored the script to improve the execution time.

### Reslts
Below you can see the stock performances for 2017 and 2018. Overall, green stocks in 2017 outperformed those same stocks in 2018. the execution times - for each year - of the original scripts versus the refactored scripts.  Stock performances were signficantly better in 2017 compared to The analysis is well described with screenshots and code.
